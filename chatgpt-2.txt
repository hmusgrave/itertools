I was having a delightful conversation with you earlier, and it was a continuation of a previous thread. I'm going to use doubled square brackets [[]] to delimit when you were talking vs when I was talking, and the inner conversation will be delimited with double angle brackets <<>>. Please remember everything I say here so that we can pick up where we left off.
