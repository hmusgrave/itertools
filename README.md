# itertools

tools for iterators in Zig

## Purpose

Iterators are a common enough pattern that it'd be nice to make them pleasant and fast. With liberal use of metaprogramming and inline evaluation we should be able to create an iteration library with a fluent syntax and minimal runtime overhead.

## Status

This is still in the ideation phase and very subject to change. It's missing basic tools you would expect from even the simplest of iteration libraries.
